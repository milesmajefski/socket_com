## Socket Communication

Maybe call it Entropy.  A peer to peer framework to share python objects over the network. Maybe there could be synchronization of sqlite dbs on each client.  In addition to the synced shared state, there could be local state as well. Personal notes that can be sent to everyone's computer for later reference.
